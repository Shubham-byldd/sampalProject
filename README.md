# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# üê∂ Husky Git Hooks Setup

This project uses **Husky** to automate Git workflows and maintain code quality through pre-commit, commit-msg, and post-merge hooks.

---

## üìÅ Git Hooks Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `commit-msg` ‚Äî ‚úÖ Commit Message Linter

**üìù What it does:**

- Validates commit messages using **Commitlint**.
- Enforces conventional commit standards.
- Blocks invalid commit messages.

**‚öôÔ∏è How it works:**  
Runs during the commit process and checks the commit message format.

```bash
npx commitlint --edit "$1"

```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ common.sh ‚Äî ‚ö° Utility Functions

**üìù What it does:**

- Provides shared utility functions for multiple Husky hooks.
- Ensures cross-platform compatibility, especially for Windows Git Bash.
  **‚öôÔ∏è How it works:**

- Defines a command_exists function to check if a command exists before execution.
- Implements a workaround for Windows Git Bash using winpty for terminal interactions.
